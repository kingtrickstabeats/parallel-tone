        Parallel Tone is a curated sound archive where ideas exist in multiple
        realities at once. Each one of my beats are made with nothing but pure creativity
        and passion for music. Take a dive into my world and see my side of music and I hope that I can inspire your future creations. 
        Enough yapping from me enjoy the website, currently I only offer mp3 and wav on the website. 
        For trackout pricing or custom beat pricing reach out to me personally and don't worry I do check my email and will get back to you in a timely manner. 
        Welcome to Parallel Tone.
